1. Install Python and Pipenv (if you haven't already):

Make sure you have Python installed on your system, and then install Pipenv using pip:

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

2. Initialize a new virtual environment for your project:

Navigate to your project directory and create a new virtual environment with Pipenv:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
pipenv install
```

This will create a `Pipfile` containing your project's dependencies and a virtual environment in the `.venv` directory.

3. Add Python dependencies to your project:

You can add Python dependencies required for your project using the `pipenv install package_name` command. For example:

```bash
pipenv install requests
```

This will add the `requests` package to your virtual environment and register it in the `Pipfile`.

4. Activate the virtual environment:

To activate the virtual environment and use the installed dependencies, run:

```bash
pipenv shell
```

This will put you inside the virtual environment, and your project's dependencies will be available.

5. Deactivate the virtual environment:

To exit the virtual environment, simply type `exit` or close the terminal.

Remember that Pipenv is specific to Python projects, and for managing Java versions, you would need to use Java-specific tools like `jenv`, as you mentioned in your original example.
